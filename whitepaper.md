Abstract. The blockchain technology has brought to life a new type of assets and thus laid ground for investments in blockchain assets. Though these new investments are available to everybody worldwide without any restrictions, doing it requires deep expertise in blockchains, understanding of the underlying technology, new ways of decision making and mastery of security tools. The investments in blockchains are also time-consuming. These factors prevent average users from investing in blockchain assets. In this paper we propose a trusted blockchain-based investment fund that will enable anybody to invest in blockchain assets without specific knowledge and without any restrictions. Despite growth opportunities due to blockchain nature of the fund  it also has  properties that are not inherent to any traditional investment funds, namely, zero-cost infrastructure, high security based on multisignature control, independence from the state-based legal systems, transparent audit-free operations, programmable due diligence, and backing by the liquid assets from the beginning.

## 1. Fund Managers
Fund managers are:
- Konstantin Lomashuk. PGP signature: [0C78 FFA2 1E9D 9145](https://keybase.io/creator)
- Vitaly Lvov. PGP signature: [0E79 77F0 221B 1773](https://keybase.io/cybermonetarist)
- Dima Starodubcev. PGP signature: [4EC7 4465 2CAA 89D4](https://keybase.io/21xhipster)

As fund managers we are responsible for:
- Making of investment decisions
- Providing efficient, transparent and provable operations
- Ensuring security and taking contingency measures

We have a unique background in managing investments into blockchains since 2011. We formed our first blockchain fund in April 2011. It had $10k, 30% were our own means. It was closed in December 2013 and had a capitalization of $240k. The overall return was 24x in 30 months.

In the end of 2014 we made an [analysis of the blockchain economy](https://cyber.fund/cyberep) [CER] and stated a hypothesis that a new type of assets like Bitcoin can grow faster than traditional assets and Bitcoin. Our second fund was formed in 01.01.2015. It had $10k, 50% were our own means. We closed it in May 2016 with 267% of profit. Each transaction was saved on blockchains. There is a [link for audit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bMrLliQXlv8a5IZPDdjZUif_5eflsO7T6rax3QL1K-A/edit#gid=1150888735) [PE2013].

## 2. Investment Strategy
Our investment strategy is based on 6 hypotheses:
- Exponential growth of information technologies in accordance with [Moore’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) [MR]
- [Ultimate efficiency](https://www.academia.edu/22691395/cyber_Rating_Crypto_Property_Evaluation) of decentralized consensus and blockchain technologies for any type of economic interactions [CR]
- Exponential growth of Bitcoin and blockchain economy in accordance with [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) [NE] and [Metcalfe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) [ML]
- Inevitable gradual reduction of Bitcoin share in blockchain economy due to similarities in evolution process of existing economic systems namely according to wealth distribution based on [Zipf's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) [ZL]
- Uneven growth of autonomous systems in accordance with [diffusion of innovations theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations) [DoI] extended with Gartner's [hype cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle) [HC] model
- Lifetime blockchain transaction volume will multiply tenfold every 18 months.

The investment can be executed if investment object (a blockchain system or a blockchain application) meets the following requirements:
- Blockchain asset is compliant [CR]
- Has no issuer risks after full project deployment
- Underlying blockchain has no single point of failure

The primary investment focus is on solutions that enable the essential autonomous infrastructure for supranational economy: decentralized computation, data storage and communications, decentralized exchanges, investment solutions, prediction markets, pegged assets protocols, cross chain gross settlement systems, identity protocols, governance and smart contract frameworks, reputation systems and social networks.

The inability to predict the future of particular asset due to [black swan events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) [BST] already has been proven. Thus, [maximalism strategies]()https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects [BM] in pursuit for maximising profits remain high risky. Our investment strategy is aimed at finding the right profit/risk ratio betting on the growth of the whole blockchain economy, not particular assets. Setting optimization goals for US dollar or bitcoins could be not the best way as blockchain economy landscape is changing rapidly. Our investment strategy relies on allocation of fund in the blockchain economy measured based on cyber•Rating. Thus, increasing the share of fund inside the whole economy we could ensure that our investment strategy provides corresponding increase in case of industry growth.

## 3. Enter and Exit Strategy
*Positioning*. Fund Managers takes exclusively long spot positions on its assets, and does not employ any hedging or short positions.

*Investment horizon*. Fund managers shall acquire assets with a long term investment horizon (2 to 5 years), provided that the assets continue to fulfil the investment Committee's satisfaction that a given investment remains fundamentally viable and provided that none of the "Exit Strategy" triggers are fulfilled.

*Enter Venues*. In principle, the Satoshi•Fund endeavours to seeks assets where ICO usually are announced on so called ICO platforms, including, but not limited to [cyber•Fund](https://cyber.fund) [CF], [TokenMarket](https://tokenmarket.net/) [TM] and [BitcoinTalk/ANN](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0) [ANN].

*Strict ICO requirements*:
- Whitepaper describe exhaustive technical details of implementation
- Proposed consensus design has no single point of failure
- Team is solid and have proven blockchain related records
- Proof-of-Concept open source code is exist

*Recommended ICO requirements*:
- There are independent security audit of the code
- There are independent investment due diligence
- The project is technically functional at the ICO date

*Exit and Balancing Venues*. In principle, the Satoshi•Fund endeavours to seeks assets which can be sold using regularly traded on popular "crypto exchanges", including, but not limited to Poloniex, Bittrex,  Bitfinex, Kraken Yunbi, Livecoin, Gatecoin.

*Investment Committee*. The Investment Committee is composed of all fund managers, and decisions are adopted by majority. The Investment Committee may be convened by a single member of this Committee. The Investment Committee is responsible for:
- Proposing new investments, within the scope of the Satoshi•Fund's investment universe
- Analysing the investment case for each proposed investment
- Reviewing, on an ongoing basis, the investment case for each of the Satoshi•Fund's holdings
- Replacing one or several holding for other holdings
- Exiting an investment, for any reason beyond "Exit Trigger Events"

*Entry Strategy*. The Satoshi•Fund will enter new long positions, based on fundamental research considerations, according to the Investment Committee's motivated decision, notably regarding viability of the proposed investment's activities, competitors, comparable price metrics, and liquidity of the investment.

Each holding will be increased or decreased each month, in order to attain a risk profile representing 4% of the portfolio's value, unless there is an Exit Trigger Event.

In the case of new issues to be acquired, which do not have any history to measure volatility, the Investment Committee will attribute an estimated historical volatility score by comparison with similar issuers.

*Exit Trigger Events*. Exit Trigger Events are events which override the Investment Committee's decisions and for the fund to liquidate an investment.

Exit Trigger Events include:
- The asset is illiquid more than 1 year;
- Development team do not publish updates more than 3 months.
- Critical issues are discovered in consensus code.

## 4. Holding Strategy
Holding blockchain assets implies additional revenue streams depending on underlying consensus. The fund managers’ goal is to maximize portfolio growth. The following sources of revenue streams are possible:

*Collateral Deposits*. It is possible that some holdings enable possibility to make nearly risk-free collaterals to perform validation or processing functions of a network. For instance Ethereum’s Casper [EC] will enable validators to earn 10% yearly interest on collateral [8]. Fund managers are responsible for appropriate actions.

*Dividends*. It is possible that assets under management will generate dividend revenue. Fund manager’s focus is on assets’ dividend distribution function that doesn’t hold counterparty risk and is completely programmatic. For instance, Melonport [MP] will have such revenue streams in case of Melonport protocol will generate transactions.

*Sharedrops*. It is possible that some asset holdings will generate new tokens. For instance, BitShares holders were sharedroped by DacPlay and Muse communities. Bitcoin holders recenlty was subject for Byteball and Stellar sharedrops. Decision of selling/holding such tokens is responsibility of fund managers.

*Forging, minting, harvesting* is a way of earning through securing a network of Proof-of-Stake systems. Fund managers are responsible for appropriate actions.

*Curation*. It is possible that some assets like Steem [STEEM] and Golos [GOLOS] can generate revenue from curation of content. Fund Managers can curate or may delegate it.

*Other activities*. It is possible that holding some tokens implies responsibilities. For instance, Augur’s REP holders should report on events’ result [REP]. Fund managers have a right to outsource these responsibilities only in case if outsourcing is based on a smart contract and is free of counterparty risks.

All potential revenue streams mentioned above increase fund’s capital and are a subject of investment under conditions defined in this document.

Holding crypto assets in some cases (for instance, BitShares [BTS], Dash [DASH], Steem [STEEM], Golos [GOLOS]) enables voting and decision making rights. Fund managers’ responsibility is to use these rights in order to maximize portfolio growth.

## 5. Structure and Limits
In order to manage target profit/risk ratio the following limits should be controlled by fund managers:
- Holding of assets based on a particular blockchain: <70% from net asset value (NAV)
- Holding of assets with similar consensus algorithm: <70% from NAV
- Holding of assets based on similar code base: <50% from NAV(excluding Bitcoin)
- Holding of an asset: >1% but <45% from NAV (excluding Bitcoin)
- Holding of assets in market segment: <40% from NAV(excluding Bitcoin)
- Holding of assets under non multisig accounts: <15% from NAV
- Holding of illiquid assets: <10% from NAV
- Holding of conditionally liquid assets: < 20% from NAV
- Holding on centralized exchanges: <10% from NAV

Illiquid asset are usually non transferable assets which are impossible to liquidate within 1 payout interval. Such assets evaluated using buy price. Conditionally liquid assets are assets which has market valuation but liquidity level do not allow liquidate position with 1 payout interval. Conditionally liquid assets are evaluated using discounted market price.

In case of non-compliant structure fund managers are responsible for appropriate actions within 48 hours.

## 6. Tokens
The Satoshi•Pie corresponds to [SPIES](http://cryptofresh.com/a/SPIES) asset ID 1.3.1010 that was created at block [5972460](http://cryptofresh.com/b/5972460) using Bitshares ­blockchain as User Issued Asset by account [satoshifund](http://cryptofresh.com/u/satoshifund) [SF]. Supply of tokens depends on incomes and outcomes of fund’s capital. Every time purchaser sends bitcoins to Satoshi•Pie bitcoin address satoshifund issues SPIES tokens based on a price which is calculated at 12.00 GMT each day.

Token Price = Value of Assets / Supply
Purchaser Tokens = Investments / Token Price - Entrance Fee

The current price of tokens is calculated as fund’s net assets value based on cyber•Rating methodology. Every time purchaser sends SPIES tokens to satoshifund account SPIES tokens are destroyed. Payout is calculated based on a price which is calculated at 12.00 GMT each day.

Token Price = Value of Assets / Supply
Investments = Purchaser Tokens * Token Price - Exit Fee

The Fund is designed in a way that at any given moment SPIES tokens are backed by 100% of crypto property under management. SPIES tokens also designed to be perfectly fungible.
A purchaser can sell SPIES tokens in the open market.

## 7. Economic Model
The economic model of Satoshi•Pie enables lifetime assets management without management fees. Hence, there are 3 sources of revenue for motivating fund managers: profitable decisions, Satoshi•Fund, a continuous development and from investment agents, and new buyers of SPIES tokens.

*Entry fee*. Any time a purchaser wants to enter the fund  5% of issued SPIES tokens is being deducted to reward fund managers, Satoshi•Fund and referrals. The allocation of rewards is the following:
- Fund managers: 2.5 % of SPIES
- Satoshi•Fund: 2.5 % of SPIES. Referrals are subject to
The primary purpose of the entry fee is a motivation of investment agents.

Minimum entrance is 10 bitcoins. If amount sent to generated address is less than 10 bitcoins it will be accumulated until reach 10 bitcoins.

*Exit fee*.  Any time a purchaser wants to exit the fund 5% of bitcoins of payout is being deducted to reward fund managers and Satoshi•Fund. The allocation of rewards is the following:
- Fund managers: 2.5% of bitcoins
- Satoshi•Fund: 2.5% of bitcoins

*Management fee*. Every month 0.2% deducted from NAV in bitcoins in order to cover management expenses.
- Fund managers: 0.1% of bitcoins
- Satoshi•Fund: 0.1% of bitcoins

The primary purpose of the exit fee is to create incentives for selling SPIES tokens in the open market.

SPIES tokens are transferable without any restrictions. Thus entering and exiting the fund is possible without fees mentioned above by trading on decentralized BitShares exchange or making private deals. This creates opportunity for primary source of revenue for fund managers and Satoshi•Fund.

Trading and transfer fees. Every time SPIES tokens are traded or transferred 0.15% is allocated as a fee managed by satoshifund account. Thus liquidity of SPIES token is a key factor to success of underlying business model of a product.

All rewards are a subject to reduction depending on a stage of development of Satoshi•Pie.

The proposed economic model is more cost efficient in comparison to traditional investment vehicles:
- No offices to operate
- No enforced legal compliance costs
- No audit costs as all transactions are accounted on blockchain or provable
- No enforced taxation losses
- Near zero IT infrastructure costs

## 8. Reporting and Transparency
Net asset evaluation of Satoshi•Pie is available here: https://cyber.fund/@satoshi_pie.

Market cap of SPIES tokens is available here: https://cyber.fund/system/SatoshiPie.

All transactions, references and proofs should be published here: https://satoshi.fund/SatoshiPie/transparency. This address should contain the following information:
- The possession proofs using public messages containing PGP fingerprints of fund’s managers signed using private keys of the published addresses
- All historical data on a daily basis
- The references to proofs on issuance and burning of SPIES
- The references to proofs on income and outcome of capital
- The references to proofs on investment decisions, trading and transfer operations

All announcements and changes to this document should be published in official twitter https://twitter.com/@satoshi_fund.

## 9. Security & Contingency
The following measures are mandatory in order to eliminate a risk of loosing private keys by fund managers:
- Primary way of storing funds is 2 of 3 multisignature accounts
- If multisignature scheme is not available any of the fund managers is assigned to store the asset

There is a working mechanism of programmed wills that will be enforced if fund managers key accounts are not in use more than 30 days. In that case the access to private keys is granted to available fund managers. If all fund managers are unavailable more than 30 days, the access is granted to a trusted person or persons with instructions for executing liquidation procedure.

The following measures are mandatory in order to reduce risk of private keys theft from fund managers:
- Majority of operations are signed using offline tools
- The access to the centralized exchanges is possible only by using two-factor authorisation
- There are other security measures taken that cannot be disclosed.

## 10. Risks
The purchase of SPIES tokens carries with it significant risks. Prior to purchasing SPIES tokens, the purchaser should carefully consider the risks disclosed in cyber•Rating methodology in Risk Assessment section [CR]. Purchasers and fund managers are exposed to the following risks: inherent risk, loss risk, theft risk, regulatory risk, miscomprehension risk. By sending bitcoins to address the purchaser agrees that he or she understands and accepts these risks and potential losses of all funds without a possibility to restore. Fund managers do not hold any risks except for risk of losing personal investments which comprise currently about 15% of assets under management.

## 11. Liquidation
The following events could trigger the liquidation procedure:
- Decision of 2 fund managers
- Fund managers alive is less than 2
- 3 months passes since one of fund managers decided to resign from position and no replacement found.

The following procedure will be executed in case of liquidation:
Liquid assets are terminated
Nonliquid assets

- All available holdings are exchanged into BTC in 2 weeks period
- All BTC are split across SPIES holders proportionally their share of SPIES tokens
- All BTC are sent to the registered addresses
- If there is an illiquid asset under possession, it is held by fund managers or a trusted person until it could be exchanged into BTC.

## 12. Taxation
No party involved with the Creation of makes any representations concerning the tax implications of the Creation of SPIES tokens or the possession or use of SPIES tokens. The purchaser bears the sole responsibility to determine whether holding of SPIES tokens or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of SPIES tokens over time have any tax implications for him/her in his/her home jurisdiction.

The SPIES tokens are issued when the purchaser sends BTC to the designated fund account. Thus the purchaser does triggers SPIES issuance by his/her own actions. To the extent permitted by law, third parties or individuals associated with the Satoshi•Fund are not liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from holding of SPIES tokens.

## 13. Weekly Valuation
Every week the following procedure should be executed in order to calculate all issuances and redeems of SPIES:
-

## 14. Issuance Process
The investment process is the following:
-
-
-
-

## 15. Redeem Process
The investment process is the following:
